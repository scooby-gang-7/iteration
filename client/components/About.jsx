        <p>
          Traveling with friends can be tough. Everyone has their own spots they
          want to hit, all during the same trip, and no one knows which ones
          you'll have time for. We wanted to create an app that would allow
          users to to create a library of places the group wants to visit during
          the trip. Users are able to interact with Google Map's API, using
          search functionality for specific places based on location and pin
          parameters that populate the database. This info is displayed from the
          database with upvote and downvote functionality, based on the specific
          trip and user database relationship. The tech stack we utilized was
          React, Express, Node, and Postgres. We wanted to We envisioned this
          application revolving around social capability - mutliple users being
          able to interact within one trip component, with real-time visuals for
          which places are most popular and agreed upon, making on-the-spot
          decisions much more possible. More doing, less deliberating, all while
          being able to visualize where the places are in relation to another.
